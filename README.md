#Implementation Details
#######################

**************
Elevator.java
**************
This is the main elevator class. 
It receives input from SampleInput.txt file in resources package and based on the mode given in the input file
it calls the relevant function i.e ModeA function or ModeB function.
It calculates the path which will be traversed by the elevator displays the output to console as well as saves the output
to outputFile.txt in resources  package.


*******************
Package: resources
*******************
This package has two text files i.e SampleInput.txt and Outputfile.txt
which stores the output generated by the function for respected input provided. 

******************
TestElevator.java
******************
This class is j-unit implementation.
I have written testcase in this to check expected output against actual output and 
to implement the same I am executing relevant mode function of elevator class.
Next I am putting assertion to compare expected output and the output stored in the output file.
